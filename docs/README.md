### Develop cross-platform applications using JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML and CSS.

Neutralino is a lightweight and portable application development framework. It lets you develop cross-platform applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

[Neutralinojs vs Electron vs NW.js](https://github.com/neutralinojs/evaluation)

### Why Neutralinojs? 

In Electron and NWjs you have to install NodeJs and hundreds of dependency libraries. Embedded Chromium and Node creates large overhead and makes even simple apps like ‚Äúhello world‚Äù considerable in size. Neutralino offers a lightweight and portable SDK which is an alternative for Electron and NW.js also with many advantages.
